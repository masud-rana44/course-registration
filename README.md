## üß© State Management Discussion

Component tree of the application:

- App
  - AppLayout
    - Header
    - Cards
      - Card
      - Card
      - Card
      - ...
    - Cart

In this application, I needed to manage two types of state: one for **courses data** and another for **selected courses**.

### Courses Data State

For courses data, I wanted to access the state within the `Cards` component to render each card appropriately. To achieve this, I decided to store the courses' data in the `AppLayout` component. Initially, I sent this data to the `Cards` component via props. The `Cards` component then used this data to render each `Card` component accordingly.

### Selected Courses State

As per the application requirements, I needed to add an event handler to each card. When this event was triggered, the result should be displayed in the `Cart` component. Specifically, I aimed to add a click event to the "select" button of the `Card` component. When a user clicked the "select" button, the course's title should appear in the `Cart` component.

To achieve this, I created the selected courses state in a common ancestor component, namely the `AppLayout` component. Within this component, I set up the selected courses state and an associated selection handler function. I then passed this handler function to the `Card` component via props. This handler was attached to the "select" button of the `Card` component. When the button was clicked, the action was executed within the handler function in the `AppLayout` component. This action updated the state accordingly.

Additionally, I passed the selected courses state to the `Cart` component. This enabled me to display the updated data from the `Cart` component. This approach ensured that both the `Card` and `Cart` components could easily access and interact with the shared state for selected courses.
